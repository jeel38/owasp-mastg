## Overview

If an application processes [Universal Link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content) payloads at runtime without proper validation, an attacker can craft malicious inbound URLs to manipulate application state or exfiltrate sensitive data. This test verifies whether the app's Universal Link processing flow can be triggered with arbitrary payloads that bypass OS level AASA domain checks, and whether the app validates those payloads before acting on them.

## Steps

1. Install the target application on a jailbroken device (@MASTG-TECH-0056).
2. Launch the app and attach a Frida script to hook the `scene:continueUserActivity:` delegate method.
3. Invoke `UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL_()` with a crafted URL to trigger the Universal Link processing flow, bypassing OS-level AASA validation.

## Observation

The output should contain the URL routing result and evidence of whether the app's Universal Link receiver (`scene:continueUserActivity:`) executed.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the output shows that `scene:continueUserActivity:` executed with the injected URL without validating its components. A `Result: true` alone is not sufficient — it may only indicate Safari handled the URL.
