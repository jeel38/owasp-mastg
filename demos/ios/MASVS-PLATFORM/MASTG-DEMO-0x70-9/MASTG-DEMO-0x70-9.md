title: Tracing Outgoing App Links with Frida
id: MASTG-DEMO-0x70-9
code: [swift]
test: MASTG-TEST-0x70-9
tools: [MASTG-TOOL-0039]

## Sample

The code snippet below shows sample code that blindly passes an unvalidated URL into `UIApplication.shared.open`, allowing the application to trigger external apps or URI schemes.

{{ ../MASTG-DEMO-0x70-1/MastgTest.swift }}

## Steps

1. Install the app on a device (@MASTG-TECH-0056).
2. Make sure you have @MASTG-TOOL-0039 installed on your machine and the frida-server running on the device.
3. Run `run.sh` to spawn the app with Frida and load the outgoing URL tracing script.
4. Interact with the app to trigger the logic that routes the user to an external link.
5. Stop the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

{{ run.sh # script.js }}

## Observation

The output contains the outgoing URL captured when the application attempts to hand off an external URL scheme to the operating system.

{{ output.txt }}

## Evaluation

The test fails because the application dynamically executes an outgoing link containing an untrusted custom scheme without sanitization. The output confirms the following behavior:

- The `[!] DYNAMIC ALERT (Outgoing): App is executing an outgoing link:`, confirms the `-[UIApplication openURL:options:completionHandler:]` API was invoked by the application.
- The app blindly attempted to trigger a dangerous, unregistered URI scheme `-> malicious-app://steal-data?payload=123`, making it vulnerable to URI Scheme Hijacking.
